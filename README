ABOUT:
        The Linux Firmware Loader Daemon monitors the kernel for firmware
        requests and uploads the firmware blobs it has via the sysfs interface.

        Two modes exist, a best-effort mode and a final mode. In the former
        mode, we will not cancel firmware requests if we cannot fulfill them,
        but in the latter we will. Typically the former mode will be used in an
        initrd, or before all relevant directories have been mounted, and the
        latter will be used when we know that no more firmware is going to
        become available.
